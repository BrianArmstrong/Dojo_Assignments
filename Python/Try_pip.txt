	stated that the requirement had already been satisfied because it had already been installed.

* pip freeze

	lists all the items required within pip, excluding editables, but pip list lists everything including editables.

* (cd ~/Desktop), then run pip freeze > requirements.txt

	created a requirements.txt that contained all of the pip freeze elements. when I "ls" I saw everything on my desktop. 

* pip uninstall Django

	created a long-ass list of django frameworks that are going to be uninstalled, which is followed by the question "Proceed (y/n)?" to which I replied "y" and django was "Sucessfully uninstalled"

* pip show Django

	as expected, nothing appeared because I "Sucessfully uninstalled" django

* pip search Flask

	essentially lists all items within pip that contain the word "Flask"
